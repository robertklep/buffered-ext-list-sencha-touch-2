Buffered Ext.List for Sencha Touch 2
====================================

An enhanced `Ext.List` which should be able to handle large(ish) lists (1000+
items) by limiting the number of rendered items using a sliding-window
approach.

__NB:__ Sencha Touch 2.1.0 beta 3 introduces a rewritten `Ext.List` component which can also handle large lists natively.
